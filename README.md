# Orbit of a body around another

**A C# project to calculate and simulate the orbit of a body around another âœ¨**

## Introduction

This project is a C# orbit simulator that calculates and simulates the orbit of a body around another, based on their masses, positions, and initial velocities.

## Features

* Calculate the orbit of a body around another
* Simulate the orbit of a body around another
* Visualize the orbit in a terminal

## Installation

To install the project, open Visual Studio and open the project in the `src` folder. Once the project is open, click the "Build" button to compile the project.

## Usage

To use the project, run the project in Visual Studio. The project will open in a terminal. You can then enter the values of the masses, positions, and initial velocities of the two bodies.

## Contribute

Contributions to the project are welcome. You can submit suggestions, bug fixes, or code via the GitHub repository page.
